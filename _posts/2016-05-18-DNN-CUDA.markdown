In post shares the installation of Deep Learning toolkits and GPU.

# GPU installation
Needs (at least) an installed GPU. Next thing is install CUDA library to control the GPU(s). Following this tutorial `http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/`

The cuda library needs a post-installation restart to detect GPU(s)

When installing cuda, I encountered a error "Failed To Fetch" related to chrome multiple times. A solution is modifying the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list` by inserting `[arch=amd64]` after the word *deb*

# Torch
Torch is an open source machine learning library, a scientific computing framework, and a script language based on the Lua programming language. It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep machine learning, and uses an extremely fast scripting language LuaJIT, and an underlying C implementation.

A good starting point for Torch is `http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html`

## Installing
For Mac and Ubuntu 12+
    
    # in a terminal, run the commands WITHOUT sudo
    git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
    cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
    ./install.sh
    
Then install cuda interface for Torch7
